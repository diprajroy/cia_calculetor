The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), introduced by Nesbitt and Young (1982), is a widely used geochemical proxy to evaluate the intensity of chemical weathering in silicate rocks and sediments. This index is particularly useful in understanding paleoclimatic conditions, sediment provenance, and diagenetic processes.
